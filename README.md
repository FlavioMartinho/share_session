# share_session

A Chrome browser extension for sharing your cookies on a given site with someone else.

## Description

How often do you share an account with a friend? You give them access to your
Netflix account or perhaps your cable account for watching the Olympics. But
this act always requires giving them your password. Instead, what if you could
log in on your own computer, then send them your session cookies? No password
lost.

## To use

1. Install the extension from the Chrome marketplace (LINK COMING SOON).

1. Make sure your friend has also installed the extension.

1. Log in to a site, right-click in the page you would like to share, and click
"Copy Session to Clipboard".

1. Paste the text contents to your friend, who can enter it in his omnibox and
    select the "Run Share Sessions command" option.
